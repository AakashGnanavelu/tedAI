CUDA_SETUP: WARNING! libcudart.so not found in any environmental path. Searching in backup paths...

DEBUG: Possible options found for libcudart.so: set()
CUDA SETUP: PyTorch settings found: CUDA_VERSION=118, Highest Compute Capability: 8.9.
CUDA SETUP: To manually override the PyTorch CUDA version please see:https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/how_to_use_nonpytorch_cuda.md
CUDA SETUP: Loading binary /home/aakash/anaconda3/envs/tedAI/lib/python3.11/site-packages/bitsandbytes/libbitsandbytes_cuda118.so...
libcusparse.so.11: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
CUDA SETUP: Problem: The main issue seems to be that the main CUDA runtime library was not detected.
CUDA SETUP: Solution 1: To solve the issue the libcudart.so location needs to be added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable
CUDA SETUP: Solution 1a): Find the cuda runtime library via: find / -name libcudart.so 2>/dev/null
CUDA SETUP: Solution 1b): Once the library is found add it to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:FOUND_PATH_FROM_1a
CUDA SETUP: Solution 1c): For a permanent solution add the export from 1b into your .bashrc file, located at ~/.bashrc
CUDA SETUP: Solution 2: If no library was found in step 1a) you need to install CUDA.
CUDA SETUP: Solution 2a): Download CUDA install script: wget https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/cuda_install.sh
CUDA SETUP: Solution 2b): Install desired CUDA version to desired location. The syntax is bash cuda_install.sh CUDA_VERSION PATH_TO_INSTALL_INTO.
CUDA SETUP: Solution 2b): For example, "bash cuda_install.sh 113 ~/local/" will download CUDA 11.3 and install into the folder ~/local
